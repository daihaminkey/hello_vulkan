# hello_vulkan

Playing with low-level computer graphics api here.

Right now following vulkan-tutorial.com, but with CLion support and basic project structure.

Planning to create custom game engine. Why? For science, of course!

Disclaimer: I have production dev and gamedev experience with C# and Python, but it's my first big project with C++, so code may be not high-end-styled, if you know, what I mean.

Any suggestions, improvments of book recomendations will be appreciated, feel free to submit issues and PRs, fork repository or DM me.
